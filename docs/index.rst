Zookeeper Watcher Daemon Docs
=============================

About
=====

`zk_watcher` is a simple service that registers
`Ephemeral Nodes <http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Ephemeral+Nodes>`__
in Apache Zookeeper based on the result of a healthcheck. The service is
available both as a Python script that you can run on your own, or as a Docker
image (`nextdoor/zkwatcher <https://hub.docker.com/r/nextdoor/zkwatcher/>`__)
that you can pull down.

The goal of `zk_watcher` is to monitor a particular service and register that
machine as a `provider` of that service at a given path on the Zookeeper
service.

A simple example is having `zk_watcher` monitor Apache httpd by running `service
apache2 status` at a regular interval and registers with ZooKeeper at a given
path (say `/services/production/webservers`). As long as the command returns
a safe exit code (`0`), `zk_watcher` will register with ZooKeeper that this
server is providing this particular service. If the hostname of the machine
is `web1.mydomain.com`, the registration path would look like this ::

    /services/production/webservers/web1.mydomain.com:80

In the event that the service check fails, the host will be immediately de-
registered from that path.
